"instructions_text" = "Re-Resolver Information\n\nRe-Resolver is a preservation attempt to revive Resolver - a once highly-rated decision making app created in Iceland - from oblivion by system updates. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/keithgee/Re-Resolver.\n\nAsk - Ask a question and then press the widget or shake the phone for a Yes/No answer.\n\nDecide - Ask a question and then press the widget or shake the phone to get a wordy answer that may be positive, negative, or ambiguous in tone.\n\nChoose - Use the + button to add options. Type a new option or use the \"Recent\" button to add a previous option. Press the \"Choose\" button and Re-Resolver will pick one of the options.\n\nDisclaimer: Re-Resolver does not contain any decision-making intelligence; it relies on a process that is statistically similar to randomness. Do not use Re-Resolver for important decisions. As with nearly all software, Re-Resolver contains bugs. Do not ever rely on technology for anything critical!\n\nCredits:\nThe palette icon was found at http://megaicons.net/iconspack-691/24003/ and is used under a Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution license.\n\nSoftware Development:\nKeith Gilbertson\nhttp://keithgilbertson.org\n\nDevice Support and Testing:\nAmanda French\nhttp://amandafrench.net/\n\nSpanish Translation:\nHilary Smith\n\nThank you to the University Libraries at Virginia Tech for support of this project.\n\nSpecial thanks to the team at Fancy Pants Global!";
