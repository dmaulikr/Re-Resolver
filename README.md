# Re-Resolver

![Decide Screen. Yes. Passion Color](docs/images/ocean_menu.png)

Re-Resolver is a preservation attempt to revive Resolver - a once highly-rated decision making app created in Iceland - from oblivion by system updates. The code is open source.

Disclaimer

Re-Resolver does not contain any decision-making intelligence; it relies on a process that is statistically similar to randomness. Do not use Re-Resolver for important decisions.

As with nearly all software, Re-Resolver contains bugs. Do not ever rely on technology for anything critical.
